# Beyond AI Hype
Lecture slides and curriculum for the "Beyond AI Hype" workshop conducted by Chinasa T. Okolo in Summer 2023. 

This material is also a supplement to the paper “Beyond AI Hype: A Hands-on Workshop Series for Enhancing AI Literacy in Middle and High School Students” in the Conference for Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT '24).

The workshop series is split into five sessions, and the accompanying [slides](https://github.com/chinasatokolo/BeyondAIHype/tree/main/slides) and [lesson plans](https://github.com/chinasatokolo/BeyondAIHype/tree/main/lesson-plans) have been provided in this repository.

### Workshop Goals
To help guide the implementation of the workshop series, we defined several goals:
* Students participating in this 5-day workshop series will learn about various aspects of AI, including the socio-ethical implications of emerging AI methods such as generative AI. 
* Students will critically engage with these methods and better understand how to use AI responsibly. 
* Students will also improve their AI literacy by learning to recognize AI-generated content and understanding the shortcomings of AI tools like large language models and text-to-image models.

### Acknowledgements
The workshops were facilitated through the [Cornell Science and Technology Entry Program-Upward Partnership (STEP-UP)](https://einhorn.cornell.edu/opportunity/science-and-technology-entry-program/) Summer Internship program. We are thankful to the students who participated in our workshop sessions.
